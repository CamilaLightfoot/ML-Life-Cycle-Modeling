# ML-Life-Cycle-Modeling
This project is part of my eCornell Machine Learning portfolio and focuses on the modeling stage of the ML life cycle. Using the Airbnb NYC Listings dataset, I trained and evaluated Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers, tuning their hyperparameters to identify the best-performing model.
